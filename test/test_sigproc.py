# Silly script to demonstrate basic functionality of the sigproc classes in the katsdisp package.
# This really needs to move to it's own package soon :)
#
# Shows the basic flow, which is to have a numpy array history container that is linked
# to an attribute in the base sigproc class ProcBlock.
# Classes inheriting from this will have a reference to this history array.
#
# Some modules such as the thresholder produce products (in this case flags),
# whilst others such as the scale simply modify the data in situ.
#
# In a live system the blocks will all be instantiated and then sit in a loop
# which updates history and then calls the proc method on each block in turn.
